## Overview
**Sanskrit NLP Library** is a high-performance open-source C++ library designed to process and analyze Classical Sanskrit texts. The library provides tools for tokenization, morphological analysis, transliteration, and syntax parsing, leveraging the rich grammatical framework of Sanskrit.

## Features

- Transliteration between Devanagari and Roman scripts
- Unicode support for Sanskrit text
- Various NLP utilities for Sanskrit
- **Unicode Support**: Handle Devanagari script and transliteration schemes like IAST and ISO 15919.
- **Tokenization**: Robust handling of Sanskrit Sandhi rules and word segmentation.
- **Morphological Analysis**: Identify roots, suffixes, and stems based on Paninian grammar.
- **Transliteration Tools**: Convert between Devanagari and Romanized scripts.
- **Syntax Parsing**: Analyze the syntactic structure of sentences using dependency-based parsing.

## Planned Features
1. **Phase 1: Foundational Tools**
   - Unicode support and transliteration.
   - Basic tokenization with Sandhi splitting.
   - Morphological analysis for stems and suffixes.

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Parsing**
   - Dependency parsing for free word order.
   - Sandhi splitting and joining tools.

3. **Phase 3: Semantic Tools**
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER) for proper nouns and places.
   - Semantic role labeling (e.g., karta, karma relationships).
